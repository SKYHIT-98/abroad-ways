              The Pearson Test of English (PTE) is an English language test on similar lines as the IELTS and the TOEFL. This computer-based exam focuses on day to day usage of the English Language as opposed to high-level English. It tests a candidate on the effective understanding of the English language on a day to day basis. The grading system used in PTE ensures a better level of understanding of the candidate’s proficiency in the English language.

              Since the PTE is a computer-based test the results are usually given within 5 business days from the test date. Some candidates receive the score within 3 days and some even within a day.

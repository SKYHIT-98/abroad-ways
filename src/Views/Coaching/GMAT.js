              <h3>What Is The GMAT Exam Like?</h3><br/>
              <p>The GRE exam consists of 3 modules:</p>{" "}
              <div class="immigrationprocess_txt">
                {" "}
                <ul>
                  {" "}
                  <li>Analytical Writing</li> <li>Verbal Reasoning</li>{" "}
                  <li>Quantitative Reasoning</li>{" "}
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                There is an option to either take a paper-based or computerized
                test. The Analytical Writing module is the first section in the
                test while the others are presented in a random order. There may
                also be un-scored sections in the tests. The duration of the test
                is about 3 hours and 45 minutes.

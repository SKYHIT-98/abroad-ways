              <h3>WHAT IS TOEFL?</h3>
              <br/>
              <p>
              TOEFL stands for Test of English as Foreign Language, and it is the most widely respected English language test that can help you “go anywhere”. Universities, workplaces and immigration departments across the English speaking world use TOEFL to gauge English comprehension abilities of candidates. TOEFL scores are accepted by more than 10,000 universities and other institutions in over 150 countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the US, the UK and all across Europe and Asia. Infact , it is the only test that simulates university classroom and campus life and was developed with the help of leading universities.

              <p>
              The TOEFL test measures all four language skills that are important for effective communication: speaking, listening, reading and writing. It reflects how language is really used with integrated tasks that combine more than one skill, just as in real academic settings. The integrated questions ask the test takers to:


              </p>
              <br/>
              <ul>
                <li>Read, listen, and then speak in response to a question</li>
                <li>Listen and then speak in response to a question</li>
                <li>Read, listen ,and then write in response to a question</li>

              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p>Typically, students must score a minimum of 80 out of a maximum of 120 to show average English proficiency. The better the scores, the better the scopes of your application package.</p>
